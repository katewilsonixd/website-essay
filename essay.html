    <h1> Saul Bass</h1>
        <br>
    <h3> Changing the Face of Movie Title Sequences </h3>

        
<p>With a modern style ahead of his time, Saul Bass was a mind to be reckoned with, working alongside symbols such as Otto Preminger, Alfred Hitchcock, and Martin Scorsese to name a few. A graphic designer, and filmmaker, an iconic corporate logo designer and most famously, a pioneer in film-title sequence design.
Bass used his understanding of movies and took the opportunity to progress the disconnected and non-existent style of film-title sequence and turned them into an additional part of the film, in which the audience could draw an understanding of the narrative and themes. It is fair to say that Saul Bass "fashioned title sequences into an art", with his influence still evident in title sequences today such as in Casino Royale (2006). The basic use of shapes, colour and motion used are much inspired by Bass’s style, while all three elements foreshadow various ideas and a dynamic is created which highlights the effect of change which has derived from his influence in movie titles.</p>

<h2> Saul Bass: The Starting Point </h2> 

    <img class="essay-images" src="img/images-essay/saulbass.jpg" alt="A portrait of Saul Bass" title= "Saul Bass" width="70%"
         />
    
<p>Born on the 8th of May 1920, Bronx, New York, Bass grew up and studied amongst The Great Depression period . However, he had ambition and followed his flair for design studying at the Arts Student League and later working for an advertising company in Manhattan. The film advertisements created during his time there replicated a negativity which Bass wanted to “elevate” away from. It arguably a ‘great’ period for America and Bass, as there was opportunity to push the film and advertisement industries in a different direction.</p>

<p>It was from Graphic design that his new ideas spiralled, while creating film symbols for advertisements he became involved with Otto Preminger. Preminger’s Carmen Jones and The Man With The Golden Arm were huge experimental breakthroughs for Bass as he answered his own quire “Why not make it move?”, referring to the static nature of title sequences at the time.Before Bass, and during that time period, film title sequences consisted of simply “identification tags”, and plain lifeless images of text, which replicated the physical opening of a novel.</p>
    
    <p> The Letter of 1940, and Act of Violence 1948 are both good examples of the original style which film titles represented, the exact style which Bass aimed to reinvent. Bass aimed to create a structure to the title sequence which consisted of a begging, middle and end. It was in this way that the introduction to a film in Bass’s ideal would become something of substance. In Martin Scorsese’s own words, Bass created “… in some cases, a mini-film within a film”. </p>
    <br>

<p>By 1955, Bass had become part of one of his most famous pieces of work, in the release of Otto Preminger’s academy award winning The Man With The Golden Arm. Preminger wanted his film to contain an intricate title sequence, which discarded the concept of projectionists routine of lifting the curtains for the audience after the title sequence was over.</p>

<p>Bass used the symbolism of a cut out arm which represented the main characters struggle and sense of disempowerment, as he battled his addiction to Heroin. 
</p>

         width="70%"/>
    <br>

<p>The stark black background used draws attention to the main focus of the title sequence and film plot which is represented in the thick white lines which continuously reappear in every slide of the sequence. Bass shows through this the control which heroin has to play in the main characters life. The crooked hand becomes a strong symbol for the film which later is famously used for the film poster, as it shows the audience the tool which the character relies upon to inject the Heroin.</p>

<p>Bass demonstrates a cross-over between literature and image, as he has carefully analyses the film, using strong imagery, symbolism and metaphor. Through these techniques Bass created a strong foreshadowing from which the audience can draw assumptions, anticipation and excitement for what will happen next before the film has begun.</p>
    
<p>The use of clean basic shapes became a symbol of Bass’s signature style and it is the basic nature of his work that makes his story telling and narration more impressive as demonstrated in The Man With The Golden Arm.
</p>

<h3>The Most Famous Graphic Designer In the World</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Bass proved to make an impression throughout the world on the release of Preminger’s film including upon Art Goodman a young designer from the United States who would later work with Bass for a large portion of his career. Similarly, a young Martin Scorsese had been impacted by Bass and thirty years later invited him to work alongside him.</p>

<p>
    By 1958 Saul Bass was significantly regarded for his style within film, labelled as “one of the most famous graphic designers in the world” . Alfred Hitchcock’s collaboration with Bass in Vertigo was proven a huge publication of his skill and ability to create something new. Hitchcock commissioned Bass to design the title sequence and poster advertisement, to create a certainty of success for his film. It was arguable that Hitchcock in fact relied upon Bass’s skills and was brought to a modern level with his graphic design skills.</p> 

<p>The spiralled shapes which progressed from a very stark and personal up-close shot of a woman’s eyes was unique and different to other pieces of work he or any other designer of the time had tried to achieve. The structure of the sequence added to the ambiance, again drawing the beginning, middle and final conclusion from the illusive shape leaving the eyes to entrancingly fading back in to the eyes. Bass’s use of the stark red colour on the model’s face, against the harsh bright neon colours of the spiral shapes, is significant in mirroring the physical feeling of the symptoms of vertigo, a classic example of his attention to the finer detail.</p>
              
  <br>

<p> From positive feedback surrounding Vertigo, Bass became involved in designing the title sequence for another Hitchcock film Psycho, 1960. Through his success in title sequence design he was also asked by Hitchcock to direct a scene within the film known as ‘the shower scene’, in which the lead female character is stabbed to death repeatedly in the bath with a knife. This scene became iconic at the time simply for the way that it had been executed and structured. Bass uses focused shots showing the character’s reactions and body movements juxtaposed against the imagery of a black bath drainer and sky view of the shower head, reflecting the characters inability to get away. Bass carried through his use of basic shapes and silhouettes in this scene as the sinister figure appears faceless under a shadow. Through Hitchcock, Bass was shown to have created a new change in the way that film direction is structured and stylised.</p>

<p>Bass’s work and style became increasingly more popular as time went on with a continuous number of regarded directors asking to work with him, including Martin Scorsese. In 1991 Cape Fear was released, with the title sequence designed and directed by Saul Bass and his wife Elaine. During this time, it was clear that Bass’s style was growing, using varied mediums of graphical computer-based design and film. The use of ocean water reflections allows Bass to use his signature style of bold colour symbolism, and foreshadowing. The red glimmers represent blood and the dark shadows, and silhouettes conveying threat. </p>
    
    <img src="img/images-essay/capefearnew.jpg" alt="Cape Fear 1991"/> 
    
    <p>Cape fear was a remake of an old 1962 thriller which interestingly highlights the change which had taken place between 1962 and 1991, shown in the movie title sequence. It is significant in the scope of change which film sequences have jumped within a thirty-year period, very arguably due to Saul Bass himself; from bold music and still font titles, to motion based sequences with plot and structure.</p>

    <h3>A Worldwide Inspiration</h3>
    <br>
    
    <p>From the 1940s to the modern-day era, Saul Bass’s style has been practised and replicated in film title and film direction. Daniel Kleinmann’s Casino Royale, 2006 is an example of Bass’s style influences today. Campbell uses a signature black silhouetted effect at the beginning of the title, as James Bonds black suited figure shoots the enemy character, dressed in black, surrounded by a bright white background. The black and white style is similar to that of The Man With Golden Arm, while there are replicating similarities to Bass’ use of spiralled shapes fading into the eyes of the character in Vertigo, as Bond fires the gun and the screen is zoomed away from his focus. Kleinman uses bold colour and heavy foreshadowing, as the silhouetted characters fight upon a playing card background, incorporating the main elements of the plot in simple imagery. </p>

                 "width="70%/>
    
    <p>Similar adaptations of Bass’s work can be seen in Disney Pixar’s Monsters Inc, 2001. Designer Geefwee Boedoe was clearly inspired by the use of simplicity and motion that Bass used and has brought the inspiration from his work into the motion pictures of the early 2000’s. The brightly patterned varied shapes which float amongst a black background in a playful and narrative motion are shown to be reflective of this. </p>

    <p>With a consistent inspiration drawn from Bass in modern day film title sequences, it is evident that Bass created an inspiration and change amongst designers. While early film titles appeared to have an alternate definition to the that of a title Bass pioneered himself, it is certain that he has not only changed the face of movie title sequences, but rather reinvented them. From a plain motionless title credit with identification of the cast and direction, to a narrative, motion introduction to the story line, Bass allows varied plots of varied genre to be interpreted and engaged with in past and present movie title sequences. </p>
